The Global Perspectives Index (GPI) departs from traditional, quantitative analyses of 
social and economic performance by ranking countries based on a <a href="https://www.gallup-international.com/survey-results/survey-result/worlds-most-important-problem">
Gallup poll</a> that asked 
the international community a question: 

"What do you think is the most important problem
facing the world today?"

The GPI takes the top four areas of concern: corruption, economy, inequality and unemployment, 
considering each according to its perceived importance. Each indicator is weighted based on 
polling strenghth, resulting in the final composite index. All values are represented as
percentiles, with higher scores reflecting better performance, and all columns can be sorted by rank.
