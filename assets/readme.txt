GPI Text

The Global Perspectives Index (GPI) departs from traditional, quantitative reviews of 
social and economic performance by ranking countries based on a Gallup poll that asked 
the international community a question: 

"What do you think is the most important problem
facing the world today?"

The GPI takes the top four areas of concern: corruption, economy, inequality and unemployment, 
considering each according to its its perceived importance. Each indicator is weighted based on 
polling strenghth, resulting in the final composite index. All values are represented as comparative
percentiles.
